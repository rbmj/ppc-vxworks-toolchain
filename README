BUILD REQUIREMENTS:

A Linux Machine with:
 - mingw-w64
 - The entire linux version of the toolchain working
 - standard build utilities

A windows machine with:
 - WiX

A directory both can access to put this in (3.5 GB disk space required).
Internet access.

COMPILING:
 - Run prepare.sh on the linux machine
 - Run make -f linux.mk on the linux machine
 - Run mingw32-make -f windows.mk on the windows machine

This will result in a MSI in the directory.

Currently, installation takes up about 500MB on the final machine.

TODO:
 - Test (priority: high)
 - Fix "Relocation value does not fit in 24 bits." error on 8 slot cRIOs (priority: high)
 - Get proper upgrade semantics for new versions (priority: high)
