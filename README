BUILD REQUIREMENTS:

A Linux machine with:
 - mingw-w64
 - the entire Linux version of the toolchain working
 - standard build utilities

A Windows machine with:
 - WiX

- A directory both can access in which to put this (3.5GB disk space required).
- Internet access.

COMPILING:
 - Run make on the Linux machine
 - Run build.bat on the Windows machine

This will result in an EXE in the wix-build directory.

Currently, installation takes up about 555MB on the final machine.

TODO:
 - Test (priority: high)
