BUILD REQUIREMENTS:

A Linux Machine with:
 - mingw-w64
 - The entire linux version of the toolchain working
 - standard build utilities.

A windows machine with:
 - wix
 - make (or mingw32-make)
 - python (3+ or 2.7+ supported)

A directory both can access to put this in (3.5 GB disk space required).
Internet access.

COMPILING:
 - Run prepare.sh on the linux machine
 - Run make -f linux.mk on the linux machine
 - Run mingw32-make -f windows.mk on the windows machine

This will result in a MSI in the directory.

Currently, installation takes up about 500MB on the final machine.

TODO:
 - Fix strange error where buildscripts feels the need to constantly reinstall
   itself (priority: low)
 - Download make binary from [1] instead of bundling a copy (priority: low)
 - Test (priority: high)
 - Get proper upgrade semantics for new versions (priority: high)
 - Figure out why heat crashes so that we don't have to roll our own script
   with python (priority: low - as long as the script works...)
